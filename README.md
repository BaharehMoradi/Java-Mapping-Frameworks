# Java-Mapping-Frameworks
Java mapping frameworks play a crucial role in simplifying the process of mapping data between different object models in large-scale applications. These frameworks eliminate the need for manual mapping code, reducing boilerplate and saving development time. By automating the mapping process, developers can easily convert data between persistence models, domain models, and DTOs. Whether it's matching properties based on naming conventions or providing explicit configuration options, these frameworks offer flexibility and convenience. Overall, Java mapping frameworks enhance productivity and maintainability by streamlining the mapping process and reducing manual effort. The below list includes several notable frameworks and libraries, such as:
## MapStruct
## ModelMapper
## JMapper
## Dozer
## dOOv
## reMap
## Orika
